# EE 123 Lab 2: Spectral Analysis — Images & Audio

This lab explores spectral analysis in two domains: images (2D DFT) and audio (FFT / STFT).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Environment Setup

Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Lab Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `lab2-spectral-analysis.ipynb` | Main lab notebook (Part 1: Images + Part 2: Audio) |
| `pictures/` | Image assets (apple, orange, cameraman) |

## Getting Started

1. Open `lab2-spectral-analysis.ipynb` and work through Part 1, then Part 2
2. Fill in all `# TODO` sections and answer the questions

## Notes

- This lab is a take-home assignment.
- In Part 2, use `IPython.display.Audio` to listen to audio clips directly in the notebook
- The hybrid image exercise works best when you experiment with different sigma values
